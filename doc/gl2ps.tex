\section{Introduction}

GL2PS is a library for creating PostScript output from any OpenGL
application. Though it was primarily designed for three-dimensional geometry,
mesh and post-processing visualization, it may be useful every time high quality
vector output is desired. The main difference between GL2PS and other similar
libraries is the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling intersecting and
stretched polygons, as well as non manifold objects.

The library, written in C, is released under GNU Library General Public
License (see \url{http://www.gnu.org/} for more details), and is available
at \url{http://www.geuz.org/gl2ps/}. Any corrections, questions or
suggestions should be e-mailed to \email{geuz@geuz.org}.

The interface consists of seven functions, all beginning with the prefix
\dd{gl2ps}. All the data structures and the symbolic constants peculiar to
GL2PS begin with \dd{GL2PS}.


\section{Usage}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\texttt{gl2psBeginPage} and \texttt{gl2psEndPage}}

\subsubsection{Specification}

\begin{verbatim}
void gl2psBeginPage( char *title, char *producer, GLint format,
                     GLint sort, GLint options, GLint colormode,
                     GLint colorsize, GL2PSrgba *colortable,
                     GLint buffersize,
                     FILE *stream, char *filename )
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
void gl2psEndPage( void )
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Description}

\dd{gl2psBeginPage} and \dd{gl2psEndPage} delimit the OpenGL commands that
will be caught in the feedback buffer and output to \dd{stream}. The
parameters given to \dd{gl2psBeginPage} determine the way primitives are
handled:

\begin{description}

\item[\dd{title}] Specifies the plot title. For PostScript output, this
string is placed in the \texttt{\%\%Title} field.

\item[\dd{producer}] Specifies the plot producer. For PostScript output,
this string is placed in the \texttt{\%\%For} field.

\item[\dd{format}] Specifies the output format, chosen among:

\begin{description}

\item[\dd{GL2PS_PS}] The output stream will be a PostScript file. 

\item[\dd{GL2PS_TEX}] The output stream will be a \LaTeX\ file, containing
only the text strings of the plot (cf.\ section~\ref{sec:gl2psText}), as
well as an \verb+\includegraphics+ command permitting to include a graphic
file having the same basename as \dd{filename}.\footnote{The two steps to
generate a \LaTeX\ plot with GL2PS are thus:
\begin{enumerate}
\item generate the PostScript file (e.g.\ \dd{file.ps}) with no text
strings, using the \dd{GL2PS_PS} format combined with the \dd{GL2PS_NO_TEXT}
option;
\item generate the \LaTeX\ file \dd{file.tex}, using the \dd{GL2PS_TEX}
format and specifying \dd{file.tex} as the \dd{filename} argument to
\dd{gl2psBeginPage}.
\end{enumerate}
You can of course combine the \LaTeX\ output with other graphic formats than
PostScript. For example, you may transform \dd{file.ps} into \dd{file.pdf}
and use pdf\LaTeX\ with the same \dd{file.tex} as for PostScript. You may
also use a bitmap image (e.g.\ Jpeg or png) and still combine it with
\dd{file.tex}.}

\end{description}

\item[\dd{sort}] Specifies the sorting algorithm, chosen among:

\begin{description}

\item[\dd{GL2PS_NO_SORT}] The primitives are not sorted, and are output in
\dd{stream} in the order they appear in the feedback buffer.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_SIMPLE_SORT}] The primitives are sorted according to their
barycenter. This can be sufficient for simple scenes.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_BSP_SORT}] The primitives are inserted in a BSP tree. The
tree is then traversed back to front in a painter-like algorithm. This
should be used for complex three-dimensional scenes, but keep in mind that
the BSP tree algorithm is quite memory hungry...

\end{description}

\item[\dd{options}] Sets global plot options, chosen among (multiple options
can be combined with the bitwise inclusive OR symbol \dd{|}):

\begin{description}

\item[\dd{GL2PS_NONE}] No option.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_DRAW_BACKGROUND}] The background frame is drawn.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_SIMPLE_LINE_OFFSET}] A small offset is added in the z-buffer
to all the lines in the plot. This is a simplified version of the
\dd{GL2PS_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL} functionality
(cf. section~\ref{sec:gl2psEnable}), putting all the lines of the rendered
image slightly in front of their actual position. This thus performs a
simple anti-aliasing solution, e.g. for finite element like meshes.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_SILENT}] All the messages written by GL2PS on the error
stream are suppressed.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_BEST_ROOT}] The construction of the BSP tree is optimized by
choosing the root primitives leading to the minimum number of splits. This
is (really) not efficient yet.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_NO_TEXT}] All the text strings are suppressed from
output. This is useful to produce the image part of a \LaTeX\ output.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_LANDSCAPE}] Landscape orientation instead of portrait.

%\item[\dd{GL2PS_OCCLUSION_CULL}] All the hidden polygons are removed from
%the output, thus substancially reducing the size of the output file. This
%is not functional yet.

\end{description}

\item[\dd{colormode}] Specifies the color mode: \dd{GL_RGBA} or
\dd{GL_COLOR_INDEX}.

\item[\dd{colorsize}] Specifies the size of the colormap if \dd{colormode} is
\dd{GL_COLOR_INDEX}.

\item[\dd{colortable}] Contains the colormap if \dd{colormode} is
\dd{GL_COLOR_INDEX}. This colormap must contain \dd{colorsize} elements of type
\dd{GL2PSrgba}.

\item[\dd{buffersize}] Specifies the size of the feedback buffer.

\item[\dd{stream}] Specifies the stream to which data is printed.

\item[\dd{filename}] Specifies a name for the stream to which data is
printed.

\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\texttt{gl2psText}}
\label{sec:gl2psText}

\subsubsection{Specification}

\begin{verbatim}
void gl2psText( char *string, char *fontname, GLint fontsize )
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Description}

\dd{gl2psText} permits to include text in the PostScript or \LaTeX\ output
in a very simple way. The text is inserted at the current raster position
(set by one of the \dd{glRasterPos} OpenGL commands). Beware that text will
be sorted according to the position of the leftmost element of the string
only. The parameters are:

\begin{description}
\item[\dd{string}] Specifies the text string to print.

\item[\dd{fontname}] Specifies the name of a valid PostScript font (for
example \dd{"Times"} or \dd{"HelveticaBoldItalic"}). This parameter has no
influence for \LaTeX\ output.

\item[\dd{fontsize}] Specifies the size of the font. This parameter has no
influence for \LaTeX\ output.
\end{description}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\texttt{gl2psEnable} and \texttt{gl2psDisable}}
\label{sec:gl2psEnable}

\subsubsection{Specification}

\begin{verbatim}
void gl2psEnable( GLint mode )
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
void gl2psDisable( GLint mode )
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Description}

\dd{gl2psEnable} and \dd{gl2psDisable} delimit OpenGL commands to which a local
\dd{mode} is applied. These modes are:

\begin{description}
\item[\dd{GL2PS_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL}] Tries to emulate the
\dd{GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL} functionality. The value of the offset is taken as
the current value of the corresponding OpenGL offset (set with
\dd{glPolygonOffset}). Not fully functional yet.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_POLYGON_BOUNDARY}] Not implemented yet.

\item[\dd{GL2PS_LINE_STIPPLE}] Tries to emulate the \dd{GL_LINE_STIPPLE}
functionality.
\end{description}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\texttt{gl2psPointSize} and \texttt{gl2psLineWidth}}
\label{sec:gl2psPointSize}

\subsubsection{Specification}

\begin{verbatim}
void gl2psPointSize( GLfloat value )
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
void gl2psLineWidth( GLfloat value )
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Description}

\dd{gl2psPointSize} and \dd{gl2psLineSize} emulate the standard
\dd{glPointSize} and the \dd{glLineWidth} functions. They are necessary
since the point sizes and line widths are not saved in the OpenGL feedback
buffer.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Example}

Here is a typical calling sequence to produce BSP sorted PostScript output in
the file \dd{"MyFile"}, with all the lines slightly shifted front in the
z-buffer. The \dd{draw()} function contains all the OpenGL commands.

\begin{verbatim}
FILE *fp = fopen("MyFile", "w");
int buffsize = 0, state = GL2PS_OVERFLOW;

while( state == GL2PS_OVERFLOW ){ 
  buffsize += 1024*1024;
  gl2psBeginPage ( "MyTitle", "MySoftware", 
                   GL2PS_PS, GL2PS_BSP_SORT,
                   GL2PS_SIMPLE_LINE_OFFSET | GL2PS_SILENT, 
                   GL_RGBA, 0, NULL, buffsize, fp, NULL );
  draw(); 
  state = gl2psEndPage();
}

fclose(fp);
\end{verbatim}

\noindent To output the text \dd{"MyText"} at the current raster position, the
\dd{draw()} function should contain something like:

\begin{verbatim}
gl2psText("MyText", "Courier", 12);
\end{verbatim}
