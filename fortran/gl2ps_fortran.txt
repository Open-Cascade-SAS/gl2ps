Notes to Fortran 90 wrapper to GL2PS:

The f90 wrapper is limited to the gl2psBeginPage and gl2psEndPage
routines, with limited capabilities for the former.  In a addition to
the C version of gl2psBeginPage, the Fortran version also opens the
file.  

!==
SUBROUTINE gl2psbeginpage(title, format, sort, buffersize, filename, ierr)
INTEGER :: format, sort, buffersize, ierr
CHARACTER (LEN=*) :: title, filename
!==
SUBROUTINE gl2psendpage(ierr)
INTEGER :: ierr
!==

Pre-declared constants for the values of format, sort and ierr are
defined in gl2ps_fortran.h with the same names as for the C calls.
For simplicity options and colormode are fixed to:
(GL2PS_DRAW_BACKGROUND | GL2PS_USE_CURRENT_VIEWPORT) and (GL_RGBA)
respectively.


A typical use is the following:

!==
INCLUDE 'gl2ps_fortran.h'

INTEGER :: ierr, bufsize

!...

bufsize = 1000000
ierr = GL2PS_OVERFLOW
DO WHILE(ierr == GL2PS_OVERFLOW) ! Loop until bufsize is enough
  bufsize=bufsize*2
  CALL gl2psbeginpage('geomap', GL2PS_PS, GL2PS_BSP_SORT, bufsize, &
   'geomap.ps', ierr)
  CALL display ! Call the desired display function here
  CALL gl2psendpage(ierr)
ENDDO

!...
