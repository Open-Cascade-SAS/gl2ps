Culling of occluded primitives. Anyone having experience with this,
please send me an e-mail! There are already some routines written, but
it's not ready for primetime yet...

Enhance the polygon/line/point offset stuff, enhance shading
treatment, better choice of BSP root, handle transparency (is this
possible in postscript?).

Better testing + documenting
